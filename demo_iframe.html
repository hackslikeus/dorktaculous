      <h3>My Radios</h3>
      <p>You'll find a list of internet radio stations, over 100 in all.</p>
      <p>You can scroll, filter or search for your station. You can make changes in the file "moodies.csv"</p>

      <h3>Squeezers</h3>
      <p>Click the Squeezelite button to open a modal for your favorite Squeezebox players.</p>
      <p>With a Spotify account, this is a must see.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Shut Down</h3>
      <p>For Now, a shutdown modal is found on the Radio Stations link in that menu.</p>
      <p>Since Python is running in the background generating all that sweet music already, makes sense to put the shut down there.</p>
      <p>For Now, it works, but maybe it can be ported here in the future.</p>
