# dorktaculous
building a bootstrap iframe inside a modal to display dorkbox with toggle option to mange squeezelite players in one location.

So dorkbox is fine for internet radio stations. See more on dorkbox (todo:  insert link here).  But after a couple of years, i-radios kinda get old.  And squeezelite is totally awesome, and you can manage several players plus 
dial up your spotify account, and more.
I thought it would be way cool to build a simple portal that houses an iframe to toggle between Dorkbox Radio and Squeezelite, and Dorktaculous was conceived.  Just a simple web page, iframe landing page?, and that's it!
